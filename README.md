Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Team Tracking

This Jupyter notebook provides an interactive way to track and analyze a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team's performance throughout the season. By pulling data directly from the FPL public API, it visualizes key aspects of the team's gameweek-by-gameweek performance, including:

Team Points: Compare your team's weekly points against average and highest scores in the league.

Rank Progression: Monitor changes in gameweek rank and overall rank.

Team Value: Track fluctuations in team value over time.

Captain Points Contribution: Visualize the contribution of captain points relative to total team points, with percentage overlays.

The notebook aims to help FPL managers gain insights into their teamâ€™s performance and make data-driven decisions for future gameweeks. The visualizations provide an intuitive way to analyze team performance trends and key metrics, such as captaincy effectiveness and overall rank progression.
